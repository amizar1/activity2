    <h1>About Myself</h1>

	<img src="pic.jpg" width=250""> 
	
    <p>My name is Amber Mizar. I was born in <em>Bhutan</em>, grew up in <em>Nepal</em>, 
	and did last two years of high school and some college in <em>India</em>. 
	I came to the <em>United States</em> in March of 2011 directly to Omaha Nebraska.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Childhood:</h3>
	
	<p>I was born in the lap of the Himalayan country Bhutan. 
	The political situation was not stable at that time, 
	so my family (dad, mum, myself, one younger brother and one younger sister) 
	left Bhutan and settle in Nepal.  I was six years old while we left Bhutan. 
	Our family condition was not good at that time but we the children 
	were lucky to get free education up to grade 10.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Education:</h3>
	
	<p>In 2004, I completed by grade 10 from Nepal and went to Mumbai, 
	India where my Aunt lives. I complete my high school there. 
	The I went to trade school for 2 years getting Diploma in 
	Mechanical Draftsman. After I compete my high school, 
	I started working as an Office Assistant in the Manpower consultancy 
	to support myself and my family in Nepal and take evening class. 
	After diploma in Mechanical Draftsman, I joint for my bachelor’s in science,
	Physics. In the end of my first year, I returned to Nepal and start process
	for migration to United State with my family.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h3>Life in the United States:</h3>
	
	<p>After 2 years of waiting for the process, finally on March 17, 2011 
	I came to United States with my family. It was challenging for us to adjust 
	in the American culture. There was language barrier as well. 
	After few months I start working in at Oriental Trading Company as a 
	production worker. Eventually, my dad also starts work at Tyson Food Product
	ion which support our family financially such as paying rent, bills, 
	groceries and other basic needs.</p>
	
	<p>My goal was to go back to college and complete education. 
	In 2012 I went to Metropolitan Community college and start with ESL. 
	It was challenging for me to work fulltime and go to school. 
	After a hard work, I complete my, Associate degree in Computer Technology 
	Transfer – Computer Science in 2015. Then, I transfer my credit to UNO. 
	I was not interested in the programming, so I change my major to 
	Management Information Systems. I like system development and 
	Data management.</p>
